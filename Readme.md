# SELF-STUDY

A curated collection of notebooks and resources for self-learning in data science, machine learning, and deep learning. This repository is organized by topic and includes practical examples, code, and explanations to help you master key concepts.

## Repository Structure

- **DEEP-LEARNING/**
  - **ANN/**: Artificial Neural Networks notebooks covering digit classification, customer churn, dropout layers, gradient descent, loss functions, quantization, and more.
  - **BERT/**: Notebooks on BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) for NLP tasks.
  - **CNN/**: Convolutional Neural Networks notebooks including animal classification and data augmentation techniques.
  - **pipeline/**: Notebooks demonstrating data pipeline creation and dataset caching.
  - **RNN/**: Recurrent Neural Networks notebooks focusing on word embeddings and word2vec models.

- **learning/**
  - Notebooks and scripts covering foundational machine learning topics such as LDA, Logistic Regression, PCA, Pandas, advanced numpy, regular expressions, object-oriented programming, and TensorFlow basics.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/zer-art/SELF-STUDY.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the desired topic folder and open the notebooks in Jupyter or VS Code.
3. Follow the explanations and run the code cells to learn interactively.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook or VS Code
- Recommended: Install required packages listed in each notebook as needed (e.g., numpy, pandas, tensorflow, scikit-learn).
