### File Descriptions

#### Loop Examples
- **for_loop.js**: Demonstrates the use of a `for` loop to calculate the sum of the first 10 natural numbers.
- **while_loop.js**: Uses a `while` loop for the same sum calculation.
- **doWhile_loop.js**: Shows a `do...while` loop, which runs at least once before checking the condition.
- **forIn_loop.js**: Iterates over the properties of an object using `for...in`.
- **forOF_loop.js**: Iterates over elements of an array using `for...of` and calculates their sum.

#### Practice Questions (`practice-Questions/`)
- **Ques1.js**: Prints the sum of all even numbers from 1 to 100 using both `for` and `while` loops.
- **Ques2.js**: Implements a number guessing game where the user tries to guess a randomly generated number between 1 and 100.
- **Ques3.js**: Calculates the total price of items in an array after applying a 10% discount to each item.
- **index.html**: Simple HTML file that loads `Ques2.js` for browser-based interaction.
